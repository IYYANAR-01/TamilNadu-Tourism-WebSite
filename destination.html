                <p>A chain of misty hills spread across a lush green carpet – with plenty to see, enjoy and experience. Ooty is much more than a visitor’s paradise. It lends a piece of itself to its guests that they will be thrilled to take back. One of the most beautiful hill stations in India, Ooty nestles in the Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu. An erstwhile summer resort of the British Raj in India, Ooty has transformed over the years into one of the most sought-after tourism destinations in Tamil Nadu.</p>
                <p>With a cool and soothing climate almost all year round, Ooty welcomes tourists from far and wide. It’s not just about the mountains and hills, Ooty offers much more to discerning travellers who drive up the winding roads to reach the pinnacle. Lakes, gardens, parks, peaks, waterfalls and simply amazing accommodation options. No wonder Ooty is called the 'Switzerland of India', of such grandeur is the scenic beauty the destination is so well acclaimed for. If you would love to relax over a cup of tea, sitting back and gazing at the vastness of nature, Ooty is indeed the place to be. Besides that, the Nilgiri biosphere is rich in flora and fauna, allowing you to escape into the depths of mystic jungles and explore once-in-a-lifetime experiences.</p>
                <p>Also, you just can’t afford to miss the Toy Train ride from Mettupalayam to Ooty, which is the only daily operational meter-gauge, rack railway in India, providing you with mesmerising views of the Nilgiris.</p>

A quiet hilly village where you get to experience the quaint nature and the simple village life. Tour the hamlet, make new friends, taste the local cuisine and savour the unique landscapes of Meghamalai.</b></span><br><br>
                <p>Meghamalai in Tamil translates as Paccha Kumachi ( Green hills ). Once you reach here after the riveting drive along the 18 hairpin bends, you will know how aptly it is named. Fog seems to be a perennial presence here. Experience the magic as it glides over the hills, blanketing the tea plantations and greeny ranges. Untouched by the spate of buildings, Meghamalai dabbles in a special charm. The ever pleasant weather, the quiet air and the spectacular sights make this place one of the most favored destinations. Notable landmarks here include the wildlife sanctuary, Meghamalai waterfalls, Suruli waterfalls, dams, Maharaja Mettu view point, tea, cardamom plantations and Vellimalai.</p>
                <p>Enjoy the breathtaking view of Cumbum valley from Manalar dam and the panoramic view of beautiful hamlets. Do visit the Highway point dam and Suruli theertham. Stroll along the mist laden landscapes and head to the tea estate, coffee plantations and spice gardens. Meghamalai falls is a visual treat and no matter what the season is, water gushes forth unabated. It drops down in two separate places from Surulii theertham which originates from the hills. You also get to spot wild animals like elephants, gaur and spotted deer. Keep your cameras ready as a beautiful shot is just around the corner. Head to the Silver mountain located at 1650 metres above the sea level. One of the most enchanting places here, it is blessed with natural beauty and greenery. </p>

                <p>If you’ve ever dreamt of being pampered by the lulling lullabies of Nature, and being embraced affectionately by the cool breeze that flows in from picturesque hill slopes, then Kodaikanal is indeed the place to be in to make those dreams come true. The scenic beauty of Kodaikanal never ceases to amaze travellers</p>
                <p>Referred to as the “Princess of Hills”, Kodaikanal is one of the most sought-after hill station destinations in Tamil Nadu and the whole of India. Located at about 7000 ft above the sea-level, Kodaikanal was established as a destination by British bureaucrats and Christian missionaries in the year of 1845. However, the earliest references to the stunning hill station can be found as early as the Sangam literature time. However the modern era of Kodaikanal began only after the British came in. It served as a summer retreat and a vacation spot for the colonial power. Ever since those days, Kodaikanal has been a popular choice among hill station lovers for a quick escape up the mountains.</p>
                <p>The verdant hills, the cascading waterfalls, picturesque lakes, pristine countrysides – the reason why Kodaikanal has been popular among tourists are many. For a discerning traveller, the locale offers much to see, enjoy and experience. Plenty of activities await a visitor here. Boating, cycling, horse riding and trekking are some of the most common among them. One of the other spectacles of this region is the Kurinji flower that blooms only once in 12 years, making itself a unique spectacle to watch.</p>

                <p>It is not often that you would come across a coastal destination that is filled with history and abundant natural beauty. The rare combination of these two aspects is what makes the Poompuhar Beach so special. Once a legendary port city that witnessed many historic events, the town of Poompuhar is today one of the most visited tourism destinations in the region – thanks to the impeccable beauty of the Poompuhar beach that leaves a lasting impression in the minds of visitors.</p>
                <p>The ancient beach of Poompuhar is located along the Bay of Bengal, thus reflecting the natural bliss of the region. Poompuhar was a port that flourished as early as the 4th century BC. It was once the capital of the historic Chola empire and was called Kaveripoom Pattinam or Puhar. Today, one of the principal attractions of Poompuhar is its natural and splendid beach. Picturesque and poetic, these golden sands is a venue of amusement and entertainment to people from all parts of the world. The beach begins from the river Kaveri and stretches around 3 km to the north towards Neithavasal. A granite boulder can be seen on the shore which was built to prevent erosion.</p>
                <p>One of the most important days that is celebrated on this beach is the “Chitra Pournami”, around the April-May season. People gather on the beach to take a dip and celebrate the day in great joy. Silapathikaram Art Gallery, a seven storied structure that showcases the Sangam and post-Sangam era can also be seen near the beach.</p>

A splendidly serene strip of coast along the Bay of Bengal, the Marina Beach is considered to be one of the finest beaches in India. No wonder the spot attracts thousands of visitors everyday from all parts of the world. The first choice of local people when it comes to spending a beautiful evening, Marina Beach is one of the largest urban beaches in the world.</p>
                <p>Stretching across 13 kms from Fort St. George to the northern part of Besant Nagar, this beach was nothing but a stretch of mud before the construction of the Madras Port. The same was modified to form a promenade and was named the Madras Marina by the British. During the Indian freedom struggle, the Marina Beach was a centre for social gatherings and public events. With the passage of time, Marina Beach transformed itself into a locale of leisure and entertainment. It is estimated that over 30,000 people visit the beach everyday, making the entire 13 km stretch buzzing with life.</p>
                <p>The views of the sea, the sand and the sunrise are ones to enjoy from Marina Beach. Though a popular beach destination, Marina beach isn’t considered safe to swim or host water sports due to the turbulent undercurrent. However, taking a stroll on the beach itself is an experience like few others. A 50 m high lighthouse on the beach offers a spectacular view of the city and surroundings.</p>

                <p>One of the most exotic adornments in the vast coastline of Tamil Nadu is the picturesque Dhanushkodi Beach. A highly popular tourism hotspot, Dhanushkodi Beach is visited by lakhs of tourists every year from all over the world. This pristine beach is surrounded by the Gulf of Mannar on one side and the Bay of Bengal on the other. Resting on the southern tip of Tamil Nadu, this amazing beach destination is a place rich in history, myths and beauty.</p>
                <p>The word Dhanushkodi means ‘Tip of the bow’. ‘Arichal Munai’ is the point at which the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the spot can be viewed from Dhanushkodi. It is believed that Lord Rama, from the Indian epic of Ramayana, pointed to the end of his bow and asked his troops to build a bridge across the ocean to reach the demon king Ravana’s Lanka. Ravana had abducted Rama’s wife Sita and Rama had to reach Lanka to rescue her. Thus this place occupies a significant and important position in Indian mythology and history.</p>
                <p>Extending up to 15 km in length, the Dhanushkodi Beach is one that often witnesses high tides. Despite this, the place is an ideal vacation spot for families, friends and solo travellers alike. The region also sees various migratory birds such as gulls and flamingos, adding to the natural bliss of the locale. Besides, various locations in and around Dhanushkodi are easily accessible from this beach, making it an all-round travel experience.</p>

The Airavatesvara Temple is a splendid example of a place of worship rich in grandeur, history and divinity</b></span><br><br>
                <p>Oh what a beauty it is – the grand Airavastesvara Temple in Darasuram. The temple located in Kumbakonam is a treasure-trove of history, facts and amazing art. The construction of the temple dates back to the 12th century CE and was built by the renowned Chola king Rajaraja Chola II. Architecture, sculptures, paintings, bronze casting – the temple reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Chola dynasty. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is named after ‘Airavat’, the majestic white elephant of Lord Indra.</p>
                <p>Yet another mind-blowing part of the temple are the musical steps. These 7 singing steps that lead to the altar are intricately carved and represent seven musical notes. What a fascinating work of art that dates back to thousands of years. </p>
                <p>A part of the trio of ‘Great Chola Temples’ that also include the Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur, the Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the Airavastesvara Temple is also a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The art work that adorns the temple is extremely detailed, intricate and beautiful. It’s sheer poetry in stone. Built in the Dravidian architectural style, the main stone work of the building resembles a chariot. The entire temple complex is filled with rich carvings and inscriptions that narrate stories from ancient Indian Puranas. Words don’t do justice to the charm and splendour that the structure emanates; it’s one to be seen and experienced. </p>
                <p>All these features make the temple complex a truly must-visit destination on your trip to Tamil Nadu.</p>

The Brihadeeswara Temple is a testimony to the Dravidian architecture of the Chola Period.</b></span><br><br>
                <p>One of the largest temples in India, the Brihadeeswara Temple also known as Peruvudaiyar Kovil is located in Thanjavur. Dedicate to Lord Shiva represented as a huge ‘Lingam’, the temple was built around 1010 AD by the Chola king Rajaraja Chola I. Considered as one of the three ‘Great Living Chola Temples’ along with the Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple and Airavastesvara Temple, the complex is also listed as a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p>
                <p>One of the main attractions of the temple is a big statue of Nandi, the sacred bull of Lord Shiva. 13 ft high and 16 ft wide, the statue is sculpted out of a single rock. Fortified walls rich in elaborate rock art works surround the temple and give a grand look to the entire complex. The main temple tower is 216 ft high and the tallest of its kind in the world. The complete structure of the temple is made out of granite. The main ‘Gopurams’ or gateways to the temple are splendid structures with detailed sculptures.</p>
                <p>The temple’s inscriptions and frescoes narrate the tale of the rise and decline of the city’s fortunes. The Shiva lingam or the idol is covered by the tower and is built with stones that are bonded without the use of mortar. Yet another wonder can be seen above - the stone at the top which weighs nearly 80 tons.</p>
                <p>The temple stands as a fitting example of the might and power of the Chola dynasty that once ruled over the region. It is believed that the construction of the massive temple complex took only 7 years for completion, which is a huge accomplishment considering the scale of the sculptures, art and the complex itself.</p>

Located 100 kilometres south-west of Coimbatore and north-west of Madurai, the temple is believed to have one of the six idols of Lord Muruga. There are 670 steps downhill of the hills, to reach the temple. Devotees can use the elephant path, winch and ropeway to reach the Lord’s abode.</b></span><br><br>
                <p>As per Hindu mythology, Lord Muruga came to Palani when he failed in the task given by Sage Narada. He, along with his brother Ganesha, had been asked to encircle the world thrice. The person who came to the sage after accomplishing this task would be offered gnana-palam or the fruit of knowledge. Lord Ganesh circumambulated Lord Siva and Parvathi as he saw them as his world, while Lord Muruga failed in this. Lord Muruga wanted to grow out of his boyhood, and thus he reached Palani.</p>
                <p>The idol of Lord Muruga is made up of Navapashanam or nine poisonous herbs and it was made by the great siddhaar of Hinduism, Sage Bogar between 550 to 300 BCE. The temple was constructed between the second and fifth centuries CE by the ruler of the Chera dynasty, Cheraman Perumal. The mandaps and gopurams of the temple were added by the Cholas and the Pandyas. The temple is situated on the Sivagiri Hill, the higher of the two hills in Palani. The priests who have sole  right to access the idol in the sanctum sanctorum are selected from the Gurukkal community in Palani. There is a winch-and-rope car that goes from the foothills to the top. Restrooms, benches and drinking water are available on the elephant path. Pilgrims can use the winch-and-rope car from 7.00 am to 12.30 pm and from 1.30 pm to 5 pm. On festive dates, the winch starts operating from 4.00 am.</p>
                <p>Thai-Poosam, which falls on the full moon day of the Tamil Thai month (January-February), is the most important festival of the temple.  The other festivals in Palani are the Vaikhashi-Vishakham, Pankuni-Uththiram, and the Soora-Samharam. Devotees also bear Kavadi (an ornamental mount decorated with flowers, tinsel work, and glazed paper) on their shoulders. Tonsuring is an important tradition of the temple. The idol is also anointed with sandalwood paste, oil and milk, and this abhishekam is a common form of worship in Palani. The temple is open from 6.00 am to 8.00 pm and on festival days,  from 4.30 am.</p>

The Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is a repository of the ageless sculptures of the Chola period in South India.</b></span><br><br>
                        <p>Gangaikonda Cholapuram or Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple is located in the Ariyalur district in Tamil Nadu. The temple derives its name from the ancient town it was a part of called Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which was the capital of the Chola dynasty for over 250 years. It is a part of the trip of the ‘Great Living Chola Temples’ along with the Airavastesvara Temple and Brihadeeswara Temple; also listed among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
                        <p>One of the largest temples in India, the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple has Shiva as the principal deity. The main temple tower stands 55 m tall and the imposing building is covered in rich art and sculptures that adorn the premises in absolute grandeur. The magnificent temple is built on an elevated structure. There is a splendid courtyard that is 170 m high and 98 m wide. As in the case of most Shiva temples, the principal deity is represented as a Shiva Lingam which is 13 ft tall. The main part of the structure is 341 ft high and 100 ft wide. </p>
                        <p>One of the interesting features of the temple and the town itself is the way the place got its name. Rajendra I, a Chola emperor sent his army towards the Northern parts of India to get pots of water from the holy river of Ganga. On the way, they defeated several enemy armies and came home victorious. Thus he earned the nickname Gangaikonda Chola or the one who conquered the Ganges. So when he established a new capital city, he named it Gangaikonda Cholapuram and later when the temple was built, it got the same name.</p>

                <p>Ramanathaswamy temple is known for its imposing structure, majestic towers, intricate sculptural  works and corridors, making it an architectural marvel. The main deity worshipped in the temple is in the form of lingam. There is also an idol of Nandi, which is a massive statue, about 17.5 feet tall. Other deities worshipped here include Goddess Vishalakshi, Parvathavardhini, Lord Vinayaka and Lord Subrahmanya, Utsava idol, Sayanagriha and Perumal.</p>
                <p>The legend behind the temple is associated with Lord Rama from the Indian epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama, after defeating the demon king Ravana, wanted to worship Lord Shiva as part of atonement. He asks Hanuman to bring him a Linga from Kashi. When Hanuman delayed his return, Goddess Sita made a Shivalinga using sand so that Rama could offer his prayers. It is believed that the self-same Shiva Linga, known as Ramalingam, is now worshipped at the Ramanathaswamy temple. The lingam brought by Hanuman from Kailash is called Vishwalingam.</p>
                <p>There are 22 Theerthams (holy water bodies) inside the temple where devotees bathe to atone for their sins.</p>

Take a stroll through those streets and you will quickly feel like taking a trip back in time. Monuments, temples, UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the attractions are many.</b></span><br><br>
                <p>Of all the temples and structures in the area, the Mamallapuram Shore Temple is one that will for sure blow your mind away. Believed to be built during the reign of the old Pallavan king Rajasimha/Narasimhavarman II, the structure is one of the oldest temples of significance in South India.</p>
                <p>Until recently, the shore temple was buried under sand. The temple consists of two sanctums – one dedicated to Lord Shiva and the other, Lord Vishnu. Built of cut stones and blocks of granite, the temple reflects the true essence of Dravidian architecture. A pyramidal Kutina-type tower consists of stepped stories topped by a cupola and finial. The Shore Temple complex was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other temples and monuments of Mamallapuram.</p>
                <p>Marco Polo in his travels have identified the Seven Pagodas of Mamallapuram. The shore temple is believed to be one among these Pagodas. The temple is considered to be the last among a series of seven temples built along this coastline. The 2004 tsunami exposed an old collapsed temple built of granite blocks. It is believed that six temples remain submerged in the sea.</p>
                <p>The temple complex is indeed a place of history and beauty.</p>

This temple finds mention in ancient texts and was completely devastated in 1310. The temple was restored to its original glory in the 14th century. It is quite an architectural marvel with 14 temple towers with a height ranging between 45-50 metres. A 1000 pillared hall is another major feature with exquisitely sculpted pillars. There are musical pillars which produce sounds of different scales.</p>
                <p>A large water tank lies within the temple complex. The magnificent murals on the corridor walls depict the tales from Thiruvilaiyadal puranam. Scores of devotees attend the Thirukalyanam [divine wedding] during the Chithirai Brahmotsavam which is the most celebrated festival at the Meenakshi Temple Madurai. The festival reenacts the holy marriage of deities Meenakshi Devi and Lord Sundareswarar.</p>
                <p>The Navarathri festival held during September – October also draws people in huge numbers. The other major festivals are Avani Moolam Festival during August- September and the Masi Mandala Utsavam during February – March. The mandapam hall also functions as a museum featuring antique items, coins, carvings, rare photographs and idols. Eight forms of Goddess Sakthi are featured as sculptures on the pillars of the mandapam. The Meenakshi Naicker mandapam also features sculptures depicting Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Shiva. The Muthupillai Mandapam constructed in 1613 features statues of saints of Tharukavanam.</p>

                <p>It is believed that when Sage Agastya could not witness  the divine wedding of Shiva and Parvathi due to a huge gathering, he prayed to get a view. Moved by his piety, the lord appeared in front of him with Parvathi in the marriage wear and the place came to be known as Papanasthar. The holy nature of the place and the scenic splendor make it an all time favourite. </p>
