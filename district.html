                    <p>Nestling peacefully on the banks of River Thamirabharani, Tirunelveli is the sixth largest city in Tamil Nadu. A city that reflects the grandeur of its amazing history, Tirunelveli has for a traveller many special treats and delights. Topping it are an array of temples that boast of the legacy left by the great Dravidian architectural genre. Works of art and masterpieces themselves, these temples are not just places of divine worship, but also architectural wonders.</p>
                    <p>Over 2000 years old, Tirunelveli has witnessed many decisive moments in history. Story of the etymological roots of the name Tirunelveli is fascinating as well. Legend has it that Vedasarma, an ardent devotee of Lord Siva had sown some paddy and went to the river. The region was affected by heavy rain soon, but in spite of that, the paddy did not submerge in water. Hence this place started to be addressed as “Tiru-nel-veli” (Divinely protected paddy). Through the course of history, the area has been under the dominion of various empires including the Pandyas, Cholas, Madurai Nayaks, Chanda Sahib and eventually the British. The legacy of these empires can be seen and experienced in every nook and corner of the district to this day.</p>
                    <p>A city of rich traditions, Tirunelveli is today a municipal corporation with an urban face. Not to mention the special gourmet treat known as ‘Halwa’, a melt-in-the-mouth sweet dish that is bought and taken back by people who visit the city. The city is also a venue for textile shopping and many other commercial activities.</p>

                    <p>Where myths live on, imaginations know no bounds. When at Ramanathapuram, we can't help but stop thinking about the epic of Ramayana, the conquest of Lord Rama and the triumph of good over evil. Ramanathapuram is an epitome of glory and hope. The area has also been known as Ramnad. A renowned centre since the puranic ages, Ramanathapuram includes the holy island of Rameshwaram.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that this is the spot from where Lord Rama launched his invasion of Lanka ruled by Ravana. The Rama Setu bridge believed to have been built during this invasion can still be seen today. The bridge across the sea is indeed a wonder and is believed to have been passable up to the 15th century. Today, the loo metre wide and 10 ft deep bridge is mostly submerged in water.</p>
                    <p>Ramanathapuram is a historically important town. It has been ruled over by many empires beginning from the Cholas to the British. Influences of these dynasties can be still seen and experienced today in the town and nearby areas. This makes the destination not just a pilgrimage tourism destination, but also a hub for history buffs who would love to know more about the exemplary past of the region.</p>

                    <p>A town rich in natural beauty and ancient temples, Chengalpattu is also a growing urban centre.

What makes Chengalpattu special is the rich history that the region has behind it. Chengalpattu was an erstwhile base of the Vijayanagar Kings and the French in India. The town was formerly a capital of the Vijayanagara Kings. A fortress that was built by the kings of Vijayanagara in the 16th century was for a period of time a location of great strategic importance. Later the Fort turned out to be a location of importance to the British as well.</p>
                    <p>By 1900, Chengalpattu had become a town of trade and commerce, with manufacturing of pottery and rice trade.

The lushness of the greenery around, the chill bestowed by the cool climatic conditions, the bounty of Nature in full bloom – you will have very many reasons to spend quality time up there in the mountains. Words are just not enough to describe the feel of the stay when you are the Nilgiris – a vast mountain range that is an enchanting part of the blissful Western Ghats.</p>
                    <p>Nilgiris is spread across the borders of three Indian states – Karnataka, Kerala and our own Tamil Nadu. With many hill stations and more fascinating experiences in offer, this range is a treat that you just cannot afford to miss on your trip. ‘Nilgiris’ translates as ‘blue mountains’, an attribute it gets due to the presence of Strobilanthes flower that fills the terrain. Indigenous tribal people have occupied this area for centuries. They include the Toda, Kota, Kurumba, Irula and Badagas. No historical evidence suggests that the Nilgiris were a part of any royal dynasties or empires. However by the beginning of the 19th century, the British had started developing these hills for the production of crops such as tea and coffee. Ooty, the most noted hill station in the Nilgiris, also served as the summer capital of the Madras Presidency which was under the British Raj.</p>
                    <p>A highly multilingual and multicultural district, Nilgiris speak various languages like Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Urdu, Badaga, even though the principal language prevailing in the region is Tamil. It’s a destination for a lot of diverse experiences.</p>
